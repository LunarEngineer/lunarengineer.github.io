Journal diary: Day 3 of Bill
  I've discovered that if I think, and write, in this cipher that Bill isn't able to understand my thought. This is very challenging. Bill lives in my mind, but pops in and out. 

Journal diary: Day 12 of Bill
  Bill is planning something big. Don't know what it is, yet, but he's gloating.

Journal diary: Day 20 of Bill
  Writing is getting easier. It's not as hard to think in code, now, so it doesn't take as much effort! I've got to figure out how to share the information I've got in a way that Bill won't understand, but will still let people defeat him. I've discovered that I can force him to localize to my mind (like fully present!) if I want to, but I can only hold him for a minute before I fall unconscious and release him. I should never have agreed to let him in.

Journal diary: Day 21 of Bill
  Bill tells me that he's going to trigger the weirdmageddon, again, but still won't tell me much. He's vain, so I'll continue to pry in the hopes he lets something slip. I do know that it's got something to do with the Rule of Three. The Rule of Three says that if any three people say the same thing, at the exact same time, they are bound to a celestial contract of obligation.

Journal diary: Day 22 of Bill
  Almost got caught today hiding the phone. He popped up in my head and demanded to know what I was doing; I thought quickly, lied and said I was looking for the remote. It seemed to allay his suspicions.

Journal diary: Day 27 of Bill
  Three days. That's it. That's all we have left until the weirdmageddon. Bill seems to think that it didn't matter at this point and he laid bare his plans. He's been using localized weirdmageddons to destroy cities and now he's almost ready to unleash full weirdmageddon. The whole world will be destroyed in three days... I can't believe it.

Journal diary: Day 30 of Bill
  Today. It happens today. I think I've managed to tip the authorities and I think Captain Random will be here today. Captain Random, if you're reading this, I need you to save me.
  If you can, using the rule of three, allow me to hide in your mind so I can trigger safeguards I've left in my mind to destroy Bill. Please, you're my only hope.
